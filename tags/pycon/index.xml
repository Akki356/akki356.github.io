      <description>The journey for Pycon India started at on 2nd November, 2017. It was a four day event the first two days were dev sprints and the main conference was on the 3rd and the 4th day. I left for Delhi from Mumbai on 2nd November by an early morning Flight. This was the first time i was travelling with Vistara, and yes they pamper their customers alot. The fights are on time, awesome crew and delicious food too 😛.</description>
