      <description>This is my first blog post after a long time. Previously I had a blog at akshayshipurkar.me/blog then i got a new domain name i.e akshayshipurkar.com, I had ported it to the new domain. Now i want to get the clutter of themes and wordpress updates out of the way, so i have decided to go ahead with hugo for a fresh start on this occation of Diwali. From now i will try to be consistant in blogging.</description>
