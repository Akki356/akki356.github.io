      <description>I have had a tough time installing gateone terminal for practicing for openstack coa exam. It could be frustrating and time consuming to install and get gateone terminal running. After lot of searching and toiling over this problem i finally found the solution. Its one liner but you need to have docker installed on your machine before you can run it.
Here goes the command.
 docker run &amp;ndash;name gateone -p 443:10443 -p 2345:22 -d greyltc/gateone</description>

The resumes were pouring in my mailbox all the time and around the same time we had one session with the Enterprise team who had come there to get resources from BOND.</description>
